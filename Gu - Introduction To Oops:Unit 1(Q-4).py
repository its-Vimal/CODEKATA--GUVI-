'''
Vishakan, a dedicated reader, has a limited time to indulge in his favorite activity: reading books in the library. Each book has its own unique charm, but Vishakan needs to optimize his time to read as many books as possible within his available time.

Input:

The first line contains two integers,(n) and (t) where, (1 <= n <= 10^5) and (1 <= t <= 10^9), denoting the number of books in the library and the total free minutes Vishakan has.
The second line contains( n) space-separated integers (a1, a2,...., an) where (1 <= ai <= 10^4), representing the time required to read each book.
Output:

Print a single integer, the maximum number of books Vishakan can read within his available time.
Constraints:

Vishakan has a maximum of( 10^9) minutes to spend in the library.
Each book takes between 1 and 10,000 minutes to read.
Sample input:

3 3
2 2 3

Sample output:
